                                develop, and deploy award winning, tech driven websites with modern trends in

                            <p>I have been designing websites since my first geocities page back in the 1990s! I
                                hold a Computer Science degree from Rutgers University as well as a degree in Italian.
                                My first paying client was in
                                1999, and I still do work for her to this day. Since then, I've worked on high profile
                                websites for clients such as Intel, Pfizer,
                                NBC,
                                Merck, IBM, Bausch + Lomb,

                                FAO Schwartz, Wharton and more.
                            <p>
                            <p>I currently lead the development team for W2O Group's technology arm Sentient.
                                I manage all development across the U.S. for several locations including Florham Park
                                NJ, New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, Austin, and San Francisco. In 2018,
                                my team of 9 developers was responsible for launching 245 websites, coding an average of
                                2-3 emails per
                                week, assisting with an average of 12 deployments per week, and 46 Jira tickets per day.
                                During my time there, Sentient grew from $18M of revenue in 2016 to $37M in 2017,
                                and achieved over $50M in revenue in 2018.</p>

                                had a direct impact to project KPIs. Kim is an asset and would make a great addition to
