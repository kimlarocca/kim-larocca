            <p>I like to think of myself as an "ultra stack" developer (yes, I made that up). I design,
              develop, and deploy award winning, tech driven websites with modern trends in
              mind.</p>

              <figcaption>develop</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Until "ultra stack" becomes a thing, I'm just an artsy full stack developer who
              likes to create beautiful responsive websites and is comfortable working on both the
              frontend and the backend.</p>

            <p>Between Test Driven Development, unit testing, automation, and good old-fashioned
              eyeballs on real devices, my websites are about as close to pixel perfect
              as you can get.</p>

              create and maintain your application environments wherever they may be.</p>
