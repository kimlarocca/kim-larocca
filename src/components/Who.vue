            <p>I have been designing websites since my first geocities page back in the 1990s! It may or
              may not have been dedicated to Final Fantasy VII... I
              hold a Computer Science degree from Rutgers University as well as a degree in Italian.
              My first paying client was in
              1999, and I still do work for her to this day. Since then, I've worked on high profile
              websites for clients such as Intel, Pfizer,
              NBC,
              Merck, IBM, Bausch + Lomb,
              Novartis, AstraZeneca, Celgene, Visa, Intuitive Surgical, Roche, Toys"R"Us /
              Babies"R"Us,
              FAO Schwartz, Wharton and more. Sadly, I have not made time to build a Final Fantasy XV website.
            <p>
            <p>I currently lead the front end development team at iMedia, a marketing agency in Boonton NJ, whose
              clients include ADP, Kaplan, Purdue, Susan G Komen, Carnegie Hall, Leica, Hisense, HP, Disney, Sony, Sharp
              and many more. In addition to managing the team, I act as an individual contributor. I am working to
              improve team efficiency by personally coding reusable Vue components and training the frontend developers
              on Vue & ES6. I am also working with the backend, creative and UX teams to streamline processes and
              build matching components in various CMSs, Photoshop, and Axure.</p>
            <p class="bs_margin40">When not working, you can find me rocking out with my cover band,
              playing dodgeball, reading crappy young adult fantasy novels, or playing minecraft with my kids.
